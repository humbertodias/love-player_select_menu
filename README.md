Player Select Menu is a personal project aiming at implement the Player Select Menu from the video game Street Fighter II Turbo : Hyper Fighting (SNES / Super Nintendo / Super Famicom) in Lua programming language + LÖVE (Love2d) framework.

## Potential improvements

* management of alternative costumes for each character
* selector flicker implementation (with shaders ?)
* the little plane... :heart_eyes: and the nightmarish implementation of the coordinates... :sob: (enfin, j'ai surtout la flemme...)
* implementation of the entire pre-game sequence : editor's logo, start menu, presentation of the two selected characters...

## Issues / Bugs

* out of bounds of the character selector by randomly and repeatedly pressing the directional keys very quickly

  *For you, the bug graced your game was the most important thing in your life, but for me ? It was a feature...*
